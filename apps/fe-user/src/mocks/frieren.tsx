      <h1>Frieren - a breath of fresh air in the stale world of fantasy</h1>
      <p>
      In a world where the vast majority of anime and manga titles are created with the sole purpose of making a quick buck, Frieren stands out of the crowd. It's a title that doesn't follow the usual formula, and it bring a new perspective on the world of fantasy.
      </p>
      <h2>What makes a great fiction?</h2>
      <p>
        It is fiction that is a reflection of real life. It provides a medium through which parts of reality can be analyzed. It provides events and character arcs that equate hypotheticals in our own lives, allowing us to better understand ourselves and the world around us. It's art that leaves you pondering. It's art that can even change your outlook on life.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In Death Parade, the main theme is the subjectivity of judgement. The exploration of this theme can be viewed as a reflection of the (apparent) injustices in the judicial system.
        </li>
        <li>
          In Attack on Titan, one of the themes is the perpetual cycle of hate. This reflects numerous real-life contexts, one of which is very recent as of the time of this review.
        </li>
        <li>
          In FMA, one of the themes is the law of equivalence exchange - you can't create something out of nothing; every step forward comes with hardship. Another theme is the exploitation of other peoples - symbolized by an object in the series - which is a truly heavy-hitting topic as it reflects the way the western world has been built on top of the very same thing.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why is Sousou no Frieren different?</h2>
      <p>
        Presents us with a rather bland offering on first look - a fantasy tale, with a cliche trope subversion (the demon king is already dead), and a 1000yo main character that has everything under her belt to not really faceany hardship. This template fits the mold of your average consume-then-forget isekai/fantasy title perfectly. Yet the smallest bit of introspection into the actual content raises some eyebrows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>- The pacing is abnormally slow, more akin to something that came out 30-40 years ago.</li>
        <li>- The art style is very modest. Characters aren't flashy, which is odd from a marketing standpoint.</li>
        <li>- The music is very tame. It does not pop. It fits that medieval aesthetic.</li>
        <li>- The characters aren't sexualized - referring here to the female cast which is very conservatively dressed.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These are all odd choices considering the usual formula. And the only valid explanation is that it does not need
        those - more than that, they would distract from the main theme itself.
      </p>

      <h2>So, what is the main theme?</h2>
      <p>In order to better understand it, some groundwork has to be covered:</p>

      <p>
        If you were to describe to a person 40 years ago what the modern smartphone, internet and social platforms could do, they would give you an odd look. These technological advancements have had tremendous improvements in the agency of individuals. And we all swallowed it whole, not even considering potential side effects. The internet of the early aughts is often regarded as a magical place, filled with high quality and honest information, and with like-minded users. Communities were small in size and focused on their niche. The information was carefully categorized into easily searchable wikis. Back then the internet opened the gates of knowledge to those who willed. It was a place you would PULL information from.
      </p>

      <p>
        But today? Today, social media platforms have stolen the stage and corrupted the medium with their sprofit-motivated algorithms and incentives. The infinite scroll doesn't have too many differences from a sone-armed bandit after all. This has in turn reduced our attention spans. In a race towards the bottom, content creators are creating faster
        and faster paced content. People have been conditioned to want quick and easy fixes. All communication is now
        mediated by technology. We lost the mechanisms by which we find new people - they have been replaced by platforms like Facebook and
        Linkedin, which are suffocating to be on as every interaction has become transactional - "it has to make me look
        good", "it has to promote my qualities". We have lost what we now have now come to call a "third place" where we
        can find connections being ourselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Information nowadays is heavily diluted, likely lost in miles of discord chat logs that no one bothers to synthesize, and thanks to recent advances in AI, we can't even discern anymore what was written by humans or not - what text has a true intent or is just a hollow echo of our most primal desires. These social media platforms have turned the internet into a thing that PUSHES information onto us. Now, this
        may sound like an easy problem to fix - "just turn it off lol".
      </p>

      <p>
        But there's a more insidious thing behind all of this, and that is the fact that, in essence, the internet as we know it today has become a digital pacifier. A substanceless drug that will suspend your pain. Be it the death of a relative, a breakup, intense injury, anxiety of a test, or even less intense but persistent sensations like existential dread, regret - the digital screen will find a way to keep your mind away from that pain - an incendiary scandal online, a captivating movie, a trashy anime (*deep blank stare*), a captivating video game, anything.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sociological consequence of this readily available and mostly free pacifier is that generations have been conditioned to repress their negative emotions instead of facing, exploring, and overcoming them. This results in stunted growth, as, to recall that theme from FMA - you can't have progress without hardship.
      </p>

      <p>
        The current generations have to deal with all of these side-effects and somehow find a way out of the hole
        social platforms have dug them. This is the thing from the real world that this title reflects. Having covered
        all of this, the main theme now becomes obvious - It is leaning to stop running away and open up emotionally. Recognizing that human connections and emotions are a gift, not an earthly limitation of the flesh; not something that should be repressed.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's somewhat the same message delivered in Evangelion, except it's more proactive, less cryptic, and conveyed without a world-ending pressure on the protagonist. There are also thematic similarities with Violet Evergarden, but the difference is that VE focuses on romantic love (eros), which is one of the 3 types of love. This title focuses on the other two, philos (i.e. friendships) and agape (i.e. unconditional, e.g. family members).
      </p>

      <p>
        We live in a world where turning off your socials for a week has become the spiritual equivalent of trekking in Nepal, and Sousou no Frieren sweeps in and offers a glimpse of spiritual enlightenment. This title speaks to a generation that is yearning for genuine human connection, and shows that it is possible. It highlights what truly matters in our finite lives. It shows that happiness can be found even in the absence of tech, and thus it inspires the viewer to limit / remove the use of such tech.
      </p>

      <p>
        This title landed at just the right time - not too early so that the viewers couldn't relate with the message, but not too late that everyone caught on on what is going on with these digital pacifiers and established countermeasures against them, be it societal or regulatory. Had this title come out 20 years ago, or maybe even just 15 years ago, it wouldn't have garnered the level of attention that it did today. If your survival strategy for going through childhood was emotional repression, then this show will leave you in
        awe. It will touch personal issues that are alike to your own, and the resolutions will fill you with glee, as
        if a wise elder lifted a burden from your soul with his wisdom. It will radiate a warmth that will crack the
        walls you've learnt to put up around you - and maybe will enable you to (re)discover the joys of life.
